## Search Algorithms



### Breadth-first search (BFS) 

Breadth-first search (BFS) is a search algorithm on a graph that starts at the root (start node) of the graph and looks for each of the children if it is the solution and then carries out this process for each of those children until the desired solution has been found. BFS is a form of uninformed search, as it does not use information about the search problem during the search.
